		<div id="page-title">About Me</div>
		<div id="page-content">I was 16 years old when I had my first big breakthrough. It was a Friday evening after school and the library was empty. The kids were out with their friends and parents were out with theirs. No one was there but I. I sat down at a desk and started doing something. I didn't understand it or anything that was going on around me, but it didn't matter. I found that I could "program" and that it was fun. That was the moment I understood that I was a programmer. I could have been able to think differently because I started to understand the fundamentals of computing: functions, variables, data structures, algorithms, interpreters. I could apply algorithms and write code with an interface to do things. I was writing applications. Later, when I got my programming teachers training degree, I realized that I couldn't keep up. The lab and the training were so exciting but the curriculum was so dull. Programming became a job to teach me how to do things I never needed to do. The stuff they taught me about working with data structures was great because I just wanted to understand how things worked. But programming itself became more of an obstacle to learning than anything else.</div>
